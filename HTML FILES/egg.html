                Catalpa Arces raises a wide variety of eggs, including chicken and duck. Carter Kimberlin, the youngest of the family, raises them. He loves them dearly. They have an enclsure with a little barn, and a fenced in yard. Everyday Carter collects, washes, dates, and refrigerates the eggs. He uses food safe dye to date the eggs. Everday,beyond feeding and watering, he goes out and plays with the chickens. The best part about these eggs is that due to th evariety of chicken breeds they come in a variety of colors such as white, brown, blue, pink, and even green. Every carton of eggs is a surprise to behold.
